notes:
-anything avobe the line "SIZE:" will be ignored
-there must be an empty line before section names(SIZE, PROBABILITIES, INTENSITIES)
-It is essential that the Season namees en this file are exacly the same as the names of the GameObject containing the script Season with the appropiate configuration.
-for this example we are using the 4 seasons most commonly used in the real world, but it could be different in your game.
-probabilities and intensities need to be matrices of the same siza. matching the described in SIZE
-size is defined as number of rows, number of columns

-the probabilities will be doubles in the range [0, 1]
-the intensities will be integers in the range [0, 10]
